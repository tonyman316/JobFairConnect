Project Name: Job Fair Connect

Project Abstraction:
A website for college students to make appointments for on-campus job fair interview.

Problems:
Students need to line up at each company's booth to submit their resume and have an interview. Sometimes, some companies may only interview students at specific status (eg. will graduate by the end of this quarter). Itâ€™s tiring and time-consuming.

Project Description:
A website to connect companies and students. Companies allocate interview time slot while students sign up for interviews. Interviewers and interviewees can meet up at the event at the appointed time slot.
